# Water-quality-Senor-and-Pipeline-Management-
Five sensors are being used to detect water quality. Temperature, conductivity, pH and turbidity. Flow sensor is being used for Pipeline Management to detect where the pipe is leaking.

The arduino code for the proteus simulation is added, the simulation file which have all the components is being added. The library files for all of the above can be found on the drive link shared.
